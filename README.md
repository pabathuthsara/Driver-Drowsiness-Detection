# Driver Drowsiness Detection System
An affordable, plug-and-play driver drowsiness detection system that monitors real-time facial features, heart rate (via wireless wristband), and driving patterns using accelerometer data to alert drivers and potentially prevent road accidents.

---

## Features
- Real-time **video-based drowsiness detection** (blinks, yawns, head tilt)
- **Wireless heart rate monitoring** via BLE wristband
- **Driving behavior tracking** via accelerometer (erratic movements)
- **Alert system** (buzzer/vibration) when drowsiness is detected
- Designed to be **affordable and compatible with any vehicle**
